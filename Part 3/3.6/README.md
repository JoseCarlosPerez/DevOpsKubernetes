- You don’t have to hire database developers
- You don’t have to build a database system
- You don’t have to hire a large IT crew to maintain the system
- You don’t pay the power bill for running all the servers
- A DBaaS often comes with uptime guarantees
- DBaaS teams are experienced, and know how to handle a variety of bugs and problems
- The database is off site, meaning loss of power or natural disaster at your business doesn’t affect it
- The DBaaS can usually devote more resources to their equipment, thus buying better servers and hardware than most small businesses can afford

## Cons
